We ordered miso salad, teriyaki chicken skewers, Tori ura maki, Tori no kaarage, and tonkatsu. And for dessert, the delicious white chocolate flan. The service was good, and the atmosphere was a little noisy at times, but not overly so. We love this restaurant; we've been going there for years when we're in Barcelona.",

During our week long stay, we saw two dead cockroaches, four full grown cockroaches on the bed frame, mini fridge and shower room. Day 1, we saw a dead cockroach sprawled on the bathroom floor and tried room service, which is never answered. It was stressful to be continuously watchful of our surroundings while trying to sleep or use the restroom in fear of finding another cockroach. Honestly, I don’t know why I put up with it for so long without filing a formal complaint. The only redeeming quality was the breakfast buffet which served scrambled eggs, sausages/pancakes, tater tots, juice, croissants, wheat/whole bread, fruits and coffee.",

Air condition was not working at checkin (repaired after), bad breakfast (sick after eating), loud rooms, no minibar/kettle or coffee machine, when you pass at the reception you have to wait for them to finish their discussion before they talk to you, and forget getting a Hello from them…\nYou can pay for a late check out, but you will have housekeeping that will knock on your door 3 different times after 12. No attentions for clients.\nRoom service is disaster, pizza with a bottle of olive oil poured on top, over salted pasta, and a server that asks for a tip even though gratuity is already included (even though its written on the menu that gratuity is for more than 12 persons).\nAvoid this hotel, you can find better cheaper.",

The location is perfect.  Within walking distance to the World Trade Center memorial.  The Ghostbusters building is a 5 min walk down the street.  15-20 min walk to West Broadway where there's a bunch of shopping.  There's a subway station right outside the front door which takes you uptown (Time Square, Central Park etc) and the Subway across the street takes you downton (Brooklyn) A street over at Church street is the station that takes you to JFK airport, stop at Howard Beach and take the Air Train.  The subway station at WTC takes you to Newark NJ.  And the Brooklyn Bridge is within walking distance.  If you plan on staying here, make sure you include the breakfast with your booking.  It's from 7-10 every morning.  Rooms are clean and air conditioning works great.  Highly recommend this hotel, 10/10 would stay again.",

However, we unfortunately had a few issues that we feel are quite inexcusable for the staff today...\n\nAs per usual, at the end of our meal, we'd asked for the bill, and he brought over the check and left us to discuss payment. However, after leaving, our server seemed to have disappeared, and we spent quite a while waiting for him to return to pick up our payment! We even asked a runner if he knew where our server had gone, and after looking for him, the runner said he wasn't sure. It wasn't until we had waited about 10 minutes that our server returned and picked up the bill so we could finally leave!\n\nAlong with this, we'd also had extra food left over that we asked to be packed. However, when we'd got home with the food, we realized that some of our leftovers were missing! We had ordered the Country Style Rigatoni and left a side of sausages with the bowl to have been packed, but despite leaving most of the order barely touched, the packed food we had was missing the sausages and most of the pasta! We also had a side of spinach that was still nearly full that had also been reduced into a small pint container. We're absolutely sure we had more food leftover than what was returned to us... This was food we had paid for, and food we were planning on eating after taking it home, and I feel that we should not have to double check if ALL of our food was returned to us upon leaving!\n\nI can only just hope this doesn't happen again, and I, unfortunately, will be double checking any packed up leftovers the next time we visit.",
